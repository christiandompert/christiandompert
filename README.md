### Hi, I’m @christiandompert
Working as a front-end lead developer. 
Right now I´m working with react and nextjs but been through most most of the popular js frameworks. 
My experience streches from Design ux -> Backend -> Front-end.

Always want to have the skills to do everything but frontend takes over and is my main point of focus.

Fun facts about me. 
Been working at 2 really big community sites. 
- Lunarstorm, Swedens biggest online community before facebook was a thing. The sites userbase reached over 80% of all youth in Sweden.
  That is what you call a hefty market penetration when it comes to selling ads and campaigns.
- Stardoll, a fashion community that boosted a whopping 400 million users at its peak, mostly developed in Flash and Actionscript,
  and we all know what happend to that technology...
